Preview 3 compatibility
=======================

The release updates the existing components to be compatible with `NEO v3.0.0-preview3 <https://github.com/neo-project/neo/releases/tag/v3.0.0-preview3>`_. The affected areas are again mostly network related. The executable smart contract format (NEF) and associated contract manifest classes have been added.

.. warning:: This release is not backwards compatible.
