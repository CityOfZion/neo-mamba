RC2 compatability
=======================

This release catches up with all RC2 changes done in the C# core project.

There is a significant resource difference between neo-mamba and the core C# project. As such the mamba project had to
choose a strategy that allowed faster catching up at the cost of lower code coverage and less documentation. The less
core critical changes are made, the more time can be spend on updating documentation. For now compatibility is
prioritized over the user experience.
