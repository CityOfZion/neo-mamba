Audit fixes
===========

This is a minor release fixing 2 bug discovered while auditing the TestNet up to block `670559` and MainNet up to
block `657576`. In the first bug mamba was processing a unicode escape sequence (for the '&' symbol), where as C# kept it as an escape
sequence. The second is bug was partly in the VM not creating a shared reference to the calling script hash of an
execution context. This would lead to the new `WitnessRule.CALLED_BY_ENTRY` to fail when it shouldn't.
