The modules in the root of this directory contain examples how to perform common actions on the NEO blockchain. 
The `shared` package contains all the test data and wallets that are used to set up the private network and can be ignored.

**Requirements**

Each example creates an isolated private chain allowing you to play with the code. This requires the `examples` depencencies
to be installed. 

```shell
pip install neo-mamba[examples]
```
