This project is for you if you're looking to use Python to

* Deploy smart contracts
* Transfer NEP-11 and NEP-17 tokens
* Vote for your favourite consensus node
* Interact with on-chain smart contracts
* Manage wallets
* Build and sign specialized transactions
* and more..

This SDK provides building blocks for Python developers to interact with the NEO blockchain without requiring to run a full node.
In order to interact with the chain and obtain information it relies heavily on RPC nodes. You can find a list of public RPC nodes `here <https://dora.coz.io/monitor>`_.

Please report any issues on `Github <https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-mamba/issues>`_ or submit ideas how to improve the SDK.

Also check out our Python smart contract compiler `Boa <https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo3-boa>`_ !
